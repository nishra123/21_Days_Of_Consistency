You are given a positive integer n.

Let even denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of n (0-indexed) with value 1.

Let odd denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of n (0-indexed) with value 1.

Return an integer array answer where answer = [even, odd].

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 17
Output: [2,0]
Explanation: The binary representation of 17 is 10001. 
It contains 1 on the 0th and 4th indices. 
There are 2 even and 0 odd indices.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10.
It contains 1 on the 1st index. 
There are 0 even and 1 odd indices.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> evenOddBit(int n) {
        vector<int> sol;
        vector<int> ans;
        int r,i, esum=0, osum=0;
        // converting the given number into binary values - IT'S SIMPLE LIKE THE REMAINDER FINDING!!
        while(n!=0){
            r = n%2;
            sol.push_back(r);
            n/= 2;
        }
        int m=sol.size();
        // applying given conditions
        for(i=0; i<m; i++){
            if((sol[i]==1) && (i%2==0)){
                esum++;
            }
            else if((sol[i]==1) && (i%2!=0)){
                osum++;
            }
        }
        ans.push_back(esum);
        ans.push_back(osum);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

INSIGHTS - I generally take 30 minutes around to solve easy level questions on leetcode.
But I was able to do this question in just 14 minutes - That amazed me a lot!!
