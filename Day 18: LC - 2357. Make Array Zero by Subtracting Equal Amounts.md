You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:

Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
Subtract x from every positive element in nums.
Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 100

INSIGHTS - As soon as I saw this question, the following logic jumped to my mind!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sort the vector
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        // remove duplicate elements from vector
        nums.erase( unique( nums.begin(), nums.end()), nums.end());
        // remove all zeroes from vector
        nums.erase( remove( nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0), nums.end());
        // now calculate size of vector and return it
        int n=nums.size();
        return n;
    }
};
```
