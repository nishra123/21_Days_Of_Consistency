You are given a positive integer num consisting of exactly four digits. Split num into two new integers new1 and new2 by using the digits found in num. Leading zeros are allowed in new1 and new2, and all the digits found in num must be used.

For example, given num = 2932, you have the following digits: two 2's, one 9 and one 3. Some of the possible pairs [new1, new2] are [22, 93], [23, 92], [223, 9] and [2, 329].
Return the minimum possible sum of new1 and new2.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 2932
Output: 52
Explanation: Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [29, 23], [223, 9], etc.
The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [29, 23]: 29 + 23 = 52.
Example 2:

Input: num = 4009
Output: 13
Explanation: Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [0, 49], [490, 0], etc. 
The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [4, 9]: 4 + 9 = 13.
 

Constraints:

1000 <= num <= 9999


INSIGHTS - since the given number had only 4 digits - I thought for this solution my following approach was better, giving 0 ms runtime!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSum(int num) {
        // convert given number to string
        string ans=to_string(num);
        int i;
        // sorting the string such that smaller elements come first
        sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        // putting oth and 2nd element in one string and 1st and 3rd element in other
        string sol1;
        sol1.push_back(ans[0]);
        sol1.push_back(ans[2]);
        string sol2;
        sol2.push_back(ans[1]);
        sol2.push_back(ans[3]);
        // converting them back to integer and returning answer
        return stoi(sol1) + stoi(sol2);
    }
};
```
