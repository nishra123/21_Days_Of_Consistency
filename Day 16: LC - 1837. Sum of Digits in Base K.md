Given an integer n (in base 10) and a base k, return the sum of the digits of n after converting n from base 10 to base k.

After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number, and the sum should be returned in base 10.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6 is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: n is already in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
2 <= k <= 10

INSIGHTS - First I tried using my own approach -

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        // initializing a vector
        vector <int> ans;
        while(n>0){
            // putting remainder in vector
            ans.push_back(n%k);
            n/=k;
        }
        // then calculating sum of vector elements 
        int i,a=ans.size(), sum=0;
        for(i=0; i<a; i++){
            sum+=ans[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

the runtime was 3 ms , beats 41.90%

But then I thought that I can do this thing!

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int ans=0;
        while(n>0){
            // just add remainders in loop
            ans+=n%k;
            n/=k;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

result was same: the runtime was 3 ms , beats 41.90%

Then I thought why to add that unnecessary condition of n>0 in while loop?
And then,

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int ans=0;
        while(n){
            ans+=n%k;
            n/=k;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

And the result was: runtime 0 ms , beats 100% !!!!!!!!!!!!!
