You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1


INSIGHTS -  The answer to this question was my first attempt to implement binary search!


```cpp
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        // initialize start as 0 and end as n-1 from last
        int start=0, end=n-1;
        // run a while loop
        while(start<=end){
            // find middle element by the following formula 
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            // if that element is bad as per api, decrease end by 1
            if(isBadVersion(mid)){
                end=mid-1;
            }
            // if that element is not bad, increase start by 1
            else if(!isBadVersion(mid)){
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
        // return start
        return start;
    }
};
```
