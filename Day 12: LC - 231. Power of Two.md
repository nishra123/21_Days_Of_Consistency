Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: false
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

INSIGHTS - I first solved it using while loop - the basic remainder method!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if(n==0){
            return false;
        }
        while(n%2==0){
            n/=2;
        }
        // if n comes 1 return true otherwise false
        return n==1;
    }
};
```
Since here they said not to use loops, This method is my favourite one -  BIT MANIPULATION (works for powers of 2 only)
Let's take some good examples :
number->binary form
3->0000 0011
4->0000 0100
5->0000 0101
6->0000 0110
7->0000 0111
8->0000 1000
The observation we can conclude is that the number which is a power of two has always compulsorily 1 true bit.

Now consider :-
bit representation of 7  -> 0111
bit representation of 8  -> 1000
bitwise AND of 7 and 8 -> 0000
we are gonna use this property for for all numbers which are powers of two!


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        long long a=n;
        if(a==0){
            return false;
        }
        // power of two numbers follow this condition
        return ((a&(a-1))==0);
    }
};
```

We can also solve this question by using log as: log10(n)/log2(n) method!
