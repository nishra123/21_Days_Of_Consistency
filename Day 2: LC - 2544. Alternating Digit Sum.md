You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 521
Output: 4
Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4.
Example 2:

Input: n = 111
Output: 1
Explanation: (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.
Example 3:

Input: n = 886996
Output: 0
Explanation: (+8) + (-8) + (+6) + (-9) + (+9) + (-6) = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int alternateDigitSum(int n) {
        // created a vector to store individual digits of number n
        vector <int> ans;
        while(n!=0){
            ans.push_back(n%10);
            n/=10;
        }
        // reversed vector so that it corresponds to original no 
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        int i,a=ans.size(), sum1=0, sum2=0;
        for(i=0; i<a; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                // calculated sum of elements at even indices
                sum1+=ans[i];
            }
            else{
                // calculated sum of elements at odd indices
                sum2+=ans[i];
            }
        }
        // returned answer as odd indices sum had to be negative 
        return sum1-sum2;
    }
};

```
