You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
The maximum number is 9969.
Example 2:

Input: num = 9996
Output: 9999
Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.
Example 3:

Input: num = 9999
Output: 9999
Explanation: It is better not to apply any change.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximum69Number (int num) {
        // "to_string" converts the given number into integer
        string ans=to_string(num);
        // iterating string via &d char : here &d specifies datatype while only d specifies int
        for(auto &d: ans){
            // we need to only change the first 6 to 9 to get max number
            if(d=='6'){
                d='9';
                break;
            }
        }
        // converts the string to integer
        return stoi(ans);
    }
};
```

INSIGHTS - In these type of questions where we have given only one integer and we have to do operations on it, then instead of converting it into array/ vector of digits by using while loop and then again converting it back into number by using while loop can cause overflow.
Thus, converting the given number into string first and then converting it back into int by using stoi avoids overflow as these are built-in functions.
