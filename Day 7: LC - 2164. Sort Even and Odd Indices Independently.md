You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:

Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is [2,1], which is the same as the initial array. 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortEvenOdd(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i, n=nums.size();
        // creating seperate vectors to store odd and even indices
        vector<int> even;
        vector<int> odd;
        vector<int> ans;
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                even.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
            else{
                odd.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        // sorting as per the given condition
        sort(even.begin(), even.end());
        // greater <int> () - FOR DESCENDING ORDER SORTING
        sort(odd.begin(), odd.end(), greater<int>());
        int a=even.size(), s=odd.size();
        // This was a bit trickiest part - vector merging; I spent 40 minutes to get this right
        for(i=0; i<n/2; i++){
            ans.push_back(even[i]);
            ans.push_back(odd[i]);
        }
        // This was again tricky - I first thought that the number of even indices= number of odd indices, but it wasn't like that ; Had to rectify that extra element and That's why need to put these conditions: more 15 minutes!
        if(a>s){
            ans.push_back(even[a-1]);
        }
        else if(a==s){
            return ans;
        }
        else{
            ans.push_back(odd[s-1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
