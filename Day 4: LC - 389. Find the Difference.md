You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int i,j, n=s.length(), m=t.length(), sum1=0, sum2=0;
        char ans;
        // calculating sum of ASCII values of all elements in string s
        for(i=0; i<n; i++){
            sum1+=s[i];
        }
        // calculating sum of ASCII values of all elements in string t
        for(i=0; i<m; i++){
            sum2+=t[i];
        }
        // finding the difference between sum of both ASCII values to get final ans
        ans=abs(sum1-sum2);
        return ans;
    }
};
```
